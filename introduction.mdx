Welcome to the Voqal documentation, your guide to the innovative Vocal Programming Assistant for IntelliJ-based IDEs. Voqal transforms your IDE experience by enabling voice-controlled programming, shifting from traditional GUIs to efficient Voice User Interfaces (VUIs). It's designed to understand and interpret the context of your spoken words in software development, allowing for voice-based coding, navigation, and refactoring.

With GPT-4 and OpenAI's Whisper integration, Voqal supports multiple languages and offers an intuitive interaction with your code. This tool is perfect for developers seeking a hands-free coding experience or a more natural way of interacting with their IDEs. Here, you'll learn how to set up Voqal, use basic and advanced features, and customize it to fit your coding style. Embrace the future of voice-powered software development with Voqal.
