Flowing is the process of chaining and executing [Voqal Tools](/tools) via natural spoken language. There are
no specific keywords you need to remember to get flowing, but it does help to know the names and capabilities
of the tools your Voqal Assistant has access to. The better you understand the tools at your disposal,
the easier it will be to [flow like a pro](https://media1.tenor.com/m/IsYdPRq7bjcAAAAC/why-waste-time-when-few-word-do-trick.gif).

## Flowing Basics

The basic idea behind flowing is to quickly and efficiently execute some complex operation by delegating the actual work to your Voqal Assistant.
Each tool has a specific purpose and can be used in a variety of ways. When you chain tools together, you are creating a
flow that takes the output of one tool and uses it as the input for the next tool in the chain.

Here is a simple example of a flow that opens a file and adds breakpoints to every line that calls a specific function:

> open the user endpoint file and add breakpoints to anything that calls to string

In this example, the flow is made up of two tools: [Open File](/tools/ide/open_file) and [Add Breakpoints](/tools/ide/add_breakpoint).
The flow starts by sending the argument of `user endpoint file` to the `Open File` tool. This is then executed followed by
the `Add Breakpoints` tool which takes the argument `anything that calls to string` and adds breakpoints to every line that
calls the `toString()` function.

Do note that while both "open file" and "add breakpoints" were both spoken verbatim, this is not a requirement. When
flowing, you can use any natural language you like to describe the actions you want to take. As long as you are clear about
what you want to do, Voqal will do its best to understand and execute your request.
