Voqal is fully programmable from the tools to the prompts. Being so, it is possible to create customized
Voqal assistants for various teams, projects, industries, individuals, etc. To make it easier to configure Voqal,
a configuration file can be created at `.voqal/config.json` in the root of the project. Once you create this file,
speak to Voqal to get it to respond. While responding it will notice the empty configuration file and save its
current configuration to it. You can then fully edit the underlying AI providers, tools, and prompts to your liking.
You will need to restart Voqal for the changes to take effect.

Note: Voqal is unable to see files with `.voqal` in the name. This is intended behavior to prevent Voqal from
being able to read its own confidential configuration files.
