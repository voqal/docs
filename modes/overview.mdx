<Warning>This is currently under development.</Warning>

The Voqal Assistant comes with two embedded modes: `Idle` and `Edit`.
These modes represent the different states Voqal can be in and are individually designed to handle specific types of tasks. Each mode
has access to different [Voqal Tools](/tools/overview), so it's important to be in the one. You won't be able to edit text in idle mode.

### Idle Mode

The [Voqal Idle Mode](/modes/embedded/idle) is used for a broad range of tasks as are available via [Voqal Tools](/tools/overview).
This is the default mode your Voqal Assistant will be in when not actively engaged in a specific task.

### Edit Mode

The [Voqal Edit Mode](/modes/embedded/edit) is used for editing code and other textual content. This mode is designed to
allow for a conversational-style editing experience, where you can continuously edit and refine the generated text. Once
you're done editing, you can say "looks good" to save your changes and return to the idle mode.
