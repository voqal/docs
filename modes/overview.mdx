<Warning>This is currently under development.</Warning>

The Voqal Assistant comes with two embedded modes: `Idle` and `Edit`.
These modes represent the different states Voqal can be in and are individually designed to handle specific types of tasks. Each mode
has access to different [Voqal Tools](/tools/overview), so it's important to be in the one. You won't be able to edit text in idle mode.

## Design

#### Workflow

- Developer starts speaking
- Voice activity detection detects speech
- Speech-to-text and intent detection run concurrently
    - Results from speech-to-text are sent to intent delay queue
    - Results from intent detection are sent to intent delay queue
- Intent delay queue waits to allow corrections (e.g. "go to line 1" becomes "go to line 1000" as new results come in)
- Intent delay queue sends final intent to the current mode
    - In idle mode, the intent is broken down into a series of ordered tasks
    - In edit mode, the intent is used to update the current text or accept/reject the changes

### Idle Mode

The [Voqal Idle Mode](/modes/embedded/idle) is used for a broad range of tasks as are available via [Voqal Tools](/tools/overview).
This is the default mode your Voqal Assistant will be in when not actively engaged in a specific task.

#### Demonstration

<video
  controls
  className="w-full aspect-video"
  src="/videos/open-and-breakpoints.mp4"
></video>

The directive `open what does this do and add breakpoints to all the return statements` is broken down using an
initial directive decomposition step which results in the following response:
```json
[
  {
    "open_file": {
      "directive": "open examples/kotlin/WhatDoesThisDo.kt"
    }
  },
  {
    "add_breakpoints": {
      "directive": "add breakpoints to all the return statements"
    }
  }
]
```

Each directive is then processed one at a time using appropriate tool:
````
## Assistant Tool Request

### open_file

```json
{
  "name": "examples/kotlin/WhatDoesThisDo.kt"
}
```
````

````
## Assistant Tool Request

### add_breakpoints

```json
{
  "line_numbers": [
    "6",
    "10",
    "14",
    "21",
    "25"
  ]
}
````

This increases the latency of the assistant, but allows for more complex tasks to be completed.

### Edit Mode

The [Voqal Edit Mode](/modes/embedded/edit) is used for editing code and other textual content. This mode is designed to
allow for a conversational-style editing experience, where you can continuously edit and refine the generated text. Once
you're done editing, you can say "looks good" to save your changes and return to the idle mode.
