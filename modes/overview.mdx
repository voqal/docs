<Warning>This is currently under development.</Warning>

The Voqal Assistant comes with five embedded modes: `Idle`, `Code`, `Dictate`, `Edit`, and `Focus`.
Each mode represents a different state Voqal can be in and is designed to handle specific types of tasks. Each mode
has access to different [Voqal Tools](/tools/overview), so it's important to be in the "right gear" for the task at hand.
You won't be able to edit text in focus mode.

### Idle Mode

The [Voqal Idle Mode](/modes/embedded/idle) is used for a broad range of tasks as are available via [Voqal Tools](/tools/).
This is the default mode your Voqal Assistant will be in when not actively engaged in a specific task.

### Code Mode

The [Voqal Code Mode](/modes/embedded/code) is used for real-time oral and written natural language programming.
It translates natural language into the closest possible code representation one to several lines of code at a time.
This prompt is designed to give developers fine-grain control over the code they write, while still providing the
benefits of natural speech programming.

### Dictate Mode

The [Voqal Dictate Mode](/modes/embedded/dictate) is used for writing long-form text, such as documentation.
This prompt translates natural language into written text as accurately as possible, including punctuation,
capitalization, and other formatting.

### Edit Mode

The [Voqal Edit Mode](/modes/embedded/edit) is used for editing code, text, and other content.
This prompt is designed for precision editing by first requiring the text which may be modified to first be focused on.

### Focus Mode

The [Voqal Focus Mode](/modes/embedded/focus) is used for focusing on specific parts of code, text, and other content.
This prompt is used as a precursor to the [Voqal Edit Mode](/modes/embedded/edit) and other modes which require a specific focus.
