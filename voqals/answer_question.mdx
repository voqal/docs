## Basic

The `Answer Question` ability of Voqal transforms your IDE into an interactive knowledge base.
Whether you're curious about the functionality of a standard library, need clarification on syntax,
or require a detailed explanation of the code you're reviewing,
Voqal leverages the context of the opened file to provide accurate responses.
By selecting specific text or code segments before invoking this feature,
you signal Voqal to concentrate its response on that snippet.
This is particularly effective for understanding the purpose and potential output of functions,
deciphering error messages, or gaining insights on optimization.
It's a handy tool for learning and ensuring best practices are followed without breaking your development workflow.
