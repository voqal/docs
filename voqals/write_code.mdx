## Basic

The `Write Code` ability of Voqal is designed to assist developers by generating code snippets directly within their IDE.
This ability is particularly useful when you need to quickly produce boilerplate code, implement a function prototype,
or even when you're stuck on a particular logic problem and need some inspiration for possible solutions.
By using the currently viewed file as context, Voqal intelligently understands the scope and requirements of your project.
If you have a particular section of code selected, Voqal narrows its focus to provide more targeted suggestions.
This feature can be invoked for a variety of purposes such as creating new classes, defining methods,
or even writing complete algorithms tailored to your current task.
