# Alert Me After Build

This flow is a simple example of how you can use the Github API to trigger a build and then wait for it to finish.
Once the build has finished, you will be alerted that it has completed.

To get this flow to trigger, you just need to say something like:

> build the master branch and alert me when its done

## Flow Demo
