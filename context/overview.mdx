<Warning>This is currently under development.</Warning>

Context is the information (typically audio + text) that gets passed to language model(s) when you ask your Voqal assistant to
do something. This information is used to help the language model(s) understand the meaning of your request and how best to respond
to that request. Voqal leverages this functionality by adding the available [Voqal Tools](/tools/overview) to the current context in combination with
your request and any other relevant information. It then sends that off to the language model(s) which pick and choose
which tool(s) Voqal executes to fulfill your request.

## Embedded

There are currently three embedded context providers:
 - `voqal.assistant`
 - `voqal.developer`
 - `voqal.ide`

 ## Third Party

 Not yet supported.
