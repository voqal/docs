<Warning>This is currently under development.</Warning>

Context is the information (typically audio + text) that gets passed to language model(s) when you ask your Voqal assistant to
do something. This information is used to help the language model(s) understand the meaning of your request and how best to respond
to that request. Voqal exploits this functionality by enhancing the [Voqal Library](/library/overview) with [Voqal Tools](/tools/overview)
combined with your request and any other relevant information and sends that off to the language model(s) which pick and
choose which tool(s) Voqal ultimately uses to fulfill your request.

## Embedded

There are currently three embedded context providers:
 - `voqal.assistant`
 - `voqal.developer`
 - `voqal.ide`

 ## Third Party

 Not yet supported.
