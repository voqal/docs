<Warning>This is currently under development.</Warning>

The `chunkText()` function is used to chunk large text into smaller, more manageable pieces. This functionality
is useful when editing large text or source code files (i.e. 1000+ lines of code).
This function will attempt to chunk code via natural breaks (e.g., functions, code blocks, etc) for
up to 20% of the specified limit.

## Parameters

- `viewingCode` (required): The code or text to be chunked
- `limit` (optional): The maximum number of lines or other units to include in the chunk. Starts from currently visible lines in the editor. Appends/remove text equally from the top and bottom of the chunk.
  - Default: Currently visible lines in editor
- `limitType` (optional): The type of limit, currently supporting "LINES"
  - Default: "LINES"

## Configuration

To configure the `chunkText()` function, provide the necessary parameters in your template or code. For example:

```markdown
{{ chunkText(developer.viewingCode, 400, "LINES").codeWithCaret }}
```
