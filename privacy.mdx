## Data Ownership

We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your
personal information is secure. We do not collect any personal information from you unless you provide it to us.
That means your voice interactions, source code, and any other data you provide to the Voqal Assistant are only
transmitted to the [Voqal Compute](/compute/overview) providers you choose and are never shared with us or any other third party.

## Plugin Telemetry

To help us improve the Voqal Assistant, we collect anonymous usage data created by the Voqal Assistant plugin. This
data includes which [Voqal Compute](/compute/overview) providers you use, which [Voqal Tools](#) you use, how often you use them,
and the status codes returned by their usage.
This data is used to help us understand how you use the Voqal Assistant and to identify and fix any issues you may
encounter as well as determine which features to prioritize for future development. This data is never shared with
any third party and is only used to improve the Voqal Assistant.

You can opt-out at any time by disabling the "Data Sharing" option in the plugin settings.
