## Knowledge Base Providers

### Danswer Provider

Provider: https://www.danswer.ai/

Adding support for knowledge base AI providers would allow someone to hook Voqal up to a private data source provider
and provide more accurate and relevant answers to user queries. For example, someone could hook up Voqal to Danswer
and ask Voqal if certain code has been changed, certain issues have been resolved, what issues are assigned to them, etc.
