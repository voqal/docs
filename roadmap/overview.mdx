## Fair Use Default AI Providers

### Providers

- https://voqal.dev

### Motivation

A common complaint about Voqal is that it is difficult to set up. By providing a fair use tier and using that as the default
configuration, we can make it easier for developers to get started with Voqal and see the value it provides. Once they
see the value, they can then customize their configuration to use more advanced AI providers.

## Plugin Installation Tour

### Providers

- https://voqal.dev

### Motivation

Help developers get started with Voqal by providing a guided tour of Voqal on installation. This would help developers
understand how to use Voqal and what it can do for them. It would also introduce developers to the configuration options
available to them.

## Additional IDEs

### Providers

- https://code.visualstudio.com

### Motivation

Currently, Voqal only supports JetBrains IDEs.
Adding support for Visual Studio Code would allow more developers to use Voqal.

## Self-Critique Loop

### Providers

- https://voqal.dev

### Motivation

Voqal could perform project-wide multi-step code refactoring with the help of a self-critique loop.
Currently, a developer can use Voqal to refactor code but that requires manually telling it everywhere to refactor.
With a self-critique loop, Voqal could automatically incorporate syntax and other IDE errors to autonomously
do large-scale refactoring. Then a developer could say something like `"Add a toString method to all the DTO classes and
make sure no personally identifiable information is included in the output"` and Voqal handles it.

## Knowledge Base

### Providers

- https://www.danswer.ai/

### Motivation

Adding support for knowledge base AI providers would allow someone to hook Voqal up to a private data source
and provide more accurate and relevant answers to user queries. For example, someone could hook up Voqal to Danswer
and ask Voqal if certain code has been changed, certain issues have been resolved, what issues are assigned to them, etc.

## Speaker Diarisation

### Providers

- https://picovoice.ai/platform/falcon/

### Motivation

Adding support for speaker diarisation providers would allow a developer to ensure their Voqal Assistant only responds
to them and not other people in the room. This would be useful for developers working in shared spaces.
