## Free Default AI Providers

### Providers

- https://voqal.dev

### Motivation

A common complaint about Voqal is that it is difficult to set up. By providing a free tier and using that as the default
configuration, we can make it easier for developers to get started with Voqal and see the value it provides. Once they
see the value, they can then customize their configuration to use more advanced AI providers.

## Knowledge Base

### Providers

- https://www.danswer.ai/

### Motivation

Adding support for knowledge base AI providers would allow someone to hook Voqal up to a private data source
and provide more accurate and relevant answers to user queries. For example, someone could hook up Voqal to Danswer
and ask Voqal if certain code has been changed, certain issues have been resolved, what issues are assigned to them, etc.

## Speaker Diarisation

### Providers

- https://picovoice.ai/platform/falcon/

### Motivation

Adding support for speaker diarisation providers would allow a developer to ensure their Voqal Assistant only responds
to them and not other people in the room. This would be useful for developers working in shared spaces.
