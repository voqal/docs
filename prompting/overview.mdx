<Warning>This is currently under development.</Warning>

The Voqal Assistant offers easy access to the underlying prompts used to power Voqal.
Feel free to use the prompts as they are, or customize them to fit to your needs.

## Embedded Prompts

The Voqal Assistant comes with five embedded prompts: `Code`, `Command`, `Dictate`, `Edit`, and `Focus`.
Each prompt is designed to handle a specific type of transcription. Currently, you must choose the appropriate prompt
for your desired task. In the future, the Voqal Assistant will automatically detect the type of transcription and switch
between prompts as needed.

### Code Mode

The [Voqal Code Mode](/prompting/library/code) is used for real-time oral and written natural language programming.
It translates natural language into the closest possible code representation one to several lines of code at a time.
This prompt is designed to give developers fine-grain control over the code they write, while still providing the
benefits of natural speech programming.

### Command Mode

The [Voqal Command Mode](/prompting/library/command) is used for a broad range of tasks, from writing entire functions,
opening files, and running [Custom Tools](/tools/overview#custom-tools).
This prompt is designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks which require multiple lines of code,
IDE interactions, and other triggerable actions.

### Dictate Mode

The [Voqal Dictate Mode](/prompting/library/dictate) is used for writing long-form text, such as documentation.
This prompt translates natural language into written text as accurately as possible, including punctuation,
capitalization, and other formatting.

### Edit Mode

The [Voqal Edit Mode](/prompting/library/edit) is used for editing code, text, and other content.
This prompt is designed for precision editing by first requiring the text which may be modified to first be focused on.

### Focus Mode

The [Voqal Focus Mode](/prompting/library/focus) is used for focusing on specific parts of code, text, and other content.
This prompt is used as a precursor to the [Edit Mode](/prompting/library/edit) and other modes which require a specific focus.
