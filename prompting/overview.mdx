The Voqal Assistant offers easy access to the underlying prompts used to power Voqal.
Feel free to use the prompts as they are, or customize them to fit to your needs.

## Embedded Prompts

The Voqal Assistant comes with three embedded prompts: `Code`, `Command`, and `Dictate`.
Each prompt is designed to handle a specific type of transcription. Currently, you must choose the appropriate prompt
for your desired task. In the future, the Voqal Assistant will automatically detect the type of transcription and switch
between prompts as needed.

### Code Mode

The [Voqal Code Prompt](/prompting/code/voqal) is used for real-time oral and written natural language programming.
It translates natural language into the closest possible code representation one line at a time.
This prompt is designed to give developers fine-grain control over the code they write, while still providing the
benefits of natural language programming.

### Command Mode

The [Voqal Command Prompt](/prompting/command/voqal) is used for a broad range of tasks, from writing entire functions,
opening files, and running [Custom Tools](/tools/general/custom_tool).
This prompt is designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks which require multiple lines of code,
IDE interactions, and other triggerable actions.

### Dictate Mode

The [Voqal Dictate Prompt](/prompting/dictate/voqal) is used for writing long-form text, such as documentation.
This prompt translates natural language into written text as accurately as possible, including punctuation,
capitalization, and other formatting.
