The Text-to-Speech settings can be found at: Settings -> Tools -> Voqal -> Text-to-Speech Settings.
These settings are for configuring how written text is converted into spoken words:

- **Voice**: Select the voice profile or character that will read aloud the text. This may include different accents or speaking styles.
- **Speed**: Control how fast or slow the speech is read. Slower speeds can improve clarity, while faster speeds may be better for quick listening.
- **Pitch**: Alter the highness or lowness of the voice tone. A higher pitch often conveys enthusiasm, while a lower pitch might be perceived as more serious.
- **Rate**: Adjust the speaking rate independently of the speed, which can affect the enunciation of words.
- **Volume**: Set the loudness of the speech playback to suit your environment or personal preference.
- **Reset**: Revert all text-to-speech settings back to their default values with one click.
