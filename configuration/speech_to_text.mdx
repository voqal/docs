<Warning>This is currently under development.</Warning>

The Speech-to-Text settings can be found at: Settings -> Tools -> Voqal -> Speech-to-Text.
These settings are for configuring how the system interprets and transcribes spoken language into written text:

- **Provider**: Choose which speech recognition service to use. Different providers may offer varying features and language support.
- **Voice Detection Sensitivity**: Adjust how sensitive the system is to picking up voices, which can help in minimizing background noise or accommodating for quieter speech.
