## Embedded Tools

Voqal Tools provide the functionality offered via the [Voqal Command Mode](/prompting/command/voqal). Voqal Tools are a set of conditionally
triggerable actions that can be used autonomously by the Voqal Assistant. By using these tools individually or in
combination, Voqal can perform a wide variety of tasks. The Voqal Assistant can be programmed further via
[Custom Tools](#custom-tools), allowing you to create your own tools that Voqal can then use autonomously.

### General

These tools are general purpose tools that can be used in a wide range of applications.
They are not specific to any particular domain and can be used in a wide range of scenarios.

### IDE

These tools are used to interact with the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of the Voqal Assistant.
They are used to perform tasks such as navigating the codebase, running tests, and more.

### Writing

These tools are used to assist in writing tasks. They can be used to generate code, write documentation, and more.

## Custom Tools

Uses [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to define the structure of the data that the tool expects.

### Example Usage

#### trigger_github_build

The following is an example of a custom tool that triggers a GitHub build. It takes a branch name as input
and triggers a GitHub build for the specified branch in the owner/repo repository.

```yaml
type: function
function:
  name: trigger_github_build
  parameters:
    type: object
    properties:
      branch:
        type: string
        description: The branch to build.
    required:
    - branch
  description: Use this tool whenever the developer asks you to trigger a github build.
    exec:
      command: gh workflow run build.yml --repo owner/repo --ref $[[branch]]
```
