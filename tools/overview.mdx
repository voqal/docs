## Voqal Tools

Voqal Tools are used to power the [Voqal Command Mode](/prompting/command/voqal). Voqal Tools are
a set of triggerable actions that can be used autonomously by the Voqal Assistant. By using these tools individually
or in combination, the Voqal Assistant can perform a wide range of tasks. The Voqal Assistant can be programmed
further via the [Custom Tool](/tools/general/custom_tool), which allows you to create your own tools that can then be used autonomously
by the Voqal Assistant.
