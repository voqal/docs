## Voqal Tools

Voqal Tools are used to power the [Voqal Command Mode](/prompting/command/voqal). Voqal Tools are
a set of triggerable actions that can be used autonomously by the Voqal Assistant. By using these tools individually
or in combination, the Voqal Assistant can perform a wide range of tasks. The Voqal Assistant can be programmed
further via the [Custom Tool](/tools/general/custom_tool), which allows you to create your own tools that can then be used autonomously
by the Voqal Assistant.

### General

These tools are general purpose tools that can be used in a wide range of applications.
They are not specific to any particular domain and can be used in a wide range of scenarios.

### IDE

These tools are used to interact with the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of the Voqal Assistant.
They are used to perform tasks such as navigating the codebase, running tests, and more.

### Writing

These tools are used to assist in writing tasks. They can be used to generate code, write documentation, and more.
